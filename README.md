# qr19: The QR Engine That Actually Works
### Distilled. Jargon-free. Precision-engineered.

Let’s be honest: the world didn’t need another QR generator. It needed a *better* one. One that doesn’t ask for your credit card, doesn’t show you 50 "Download Now" ads that are actually malware, and doesn't look like it was designed in 2004.

Welcome to **qr19**. The precision engine for people who care about pixels.

## 🚀 The "Two-Click" Workflow
We’ve achieved peak productivity by removing the most dangerous thing in software: **Redundant Steps**.
1. **Choose Content**: Pick your poison (URL, vCard, WhatsApp, etc.).
2. **Design & Export**: Tweak it, color it, and download it. No "Step 3", no "Continue" buttons, no soul-crushing delays.

## 🛠️ Feature Flex (Total Overkill)
We don't just do links. We do *important* things:
- 🌐 **Websites**: Link to your blog, your portfolio, or just Rickroll people like it's 2008.
- 📇 **Contacts (vCard)**: Share your digital soul. Great for when you've run out of paper business cards (or never had them).
- 💬 **WhatsApp/SMS**: Start a conversation without the agony of actually saving a contact first.
- 📧 **Direct Email**: Pre-fill a subject and body. Perfect for those "I'm not coming in today" drafts.
- 📅 **Events**: Invite people to things they'll probably forget about anyway.

## 🎨 Studio Aesthetics
We’ve moved away from "Default Tailwind" to achieved **Rich Professionalism**:
- **Studio Presets**: Can't choose colors? We've got *Onyx*, *Midnight*, and *Electric* presets that make you look like you hired a designer.
- **Precision Branding**: Drop your logo in the middle. We've optimized the "excavation" logic so your cat's face doesn't break the scan.
- **High-Res Studio**: PNG for the old school, SVG for the vector perfectionists. PDF was removed because, honestly, who prints QRs from PDFs?

## 🛡️ Zero-Noise Policy
- **No Jargon**: We replaced "Serialization Latency" with "Loading". You're welcome.
- **No Tracking**: We don't want your data. We have enough problems already.
- **No Ads**: Because seeing a "Hot Singles in Your Area" ad while generating a business card is... sub-optimal.

## 🏗️ Technical Pedigree
Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It's fast. It's solid. It's probably more reliable than most of the apps on your phone.
