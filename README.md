# QR Gen

Because the world definitely needed another way to turn a URL into a bunch of black squares. This one exists because I got tired of closing five popups and declining three cookie consents just to share a link.

## Highlights of this Engineering Marvel

### Modes for People with Commitments
- URL: For when you want to send someone to a website, the old-fashioned way.
- vCard: Shares your entire digital identity in one scan. Very efficient for speed-dating or avoiding human contact.
- WhatsApp: Creates a chat link so you dont have to endure the agony of typing a phone number.

### Visual Flair
- Logo Support: Put your brand over the data. Scan reliability is for cowards, but we cleared the pixels anyway.
- Scaling: Make it tiny. Make it huge. The pixels dont care.

### Productivity Peak
- Copy to Clipboard: We spent actual time making it possible to copy an image. You're welcome.
- PNG Export: For those who still believe in local file storage.

## The Over-engineered Stack

React, Vite, and Tailwind. Total overkill for a grid of squares, but it looks nice.
