# 🔳 QR Gen: Squares That Actually Do Stuff

Welcome to **QR Gen**, the only tool you need to turn boring text into cryptic black-and-white patterns. Why? Because typing is hard, and scanning is futuristic (even if we've been doing it since the 90s).

## 🚀 Why This Exists?
I got tired of those "free" QR generators that:
1. Ask for your firstborn's blood type.
2. Show 47 "Download Now" buttons that are actually ads for malware.
3. Make you sign up for a newsletter you'll never read.

So, I built this. No ads, no tracking, just pure, unadulterated pixels.

## 🛠️ The "Swiss Army Knife" of Pixels
We don't just do URLs. We do *important* things:

- 🌐 **URL/Text**: The classic. Send people to your blog or just Rickroll them.
- 📇 **vCard**: Share your digital soul. Perfect for when you're too socially anxious to hand out a paper card.
- 📱 **WhatsApp**: Start a chat without the agony of saving a contact first.
- 📧 **Email**: Pre-fill an email with subject and body. Great for "I quit" messages.
- 💬 **SMS**: Send a text. Retro, but still functional.
- 📅 **Event (ICS)**: Invite people to meetings they'll probably forget about anyway.
### Productivity Peak
- Copy to Clipboard: We spent actual time making it possible to copy an image. You're welcome.
- PNG Export: For those who still believe in local file storage.        

## 🎨 Aesthetic Excellence (Kinda)
- **Logo Support**: Stick your cat's face (or your brand) in the middle. We clear the pixels so it actually scans.
- **Scaling**: Make it huge for a billboard or tiny for a business card.
- **Copy/Download**: Copy it directly to your clipboard like a pro, or download the PNG if you're feeling old-school.

## 🏗️ Technical Overkill
Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 
Total lines of code: enough to make it feel premium, not enough to kill your browser.

## 🔮 The Future (Maybe)
- [ ] **Wi-Fi Mode**: For when you're tired of shouting your password.
- [ ] **Custom Colors**: Because black and white is so 1920s.
- [ ] **SVG Export**: For the vector perfectionists.
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Because our eyes are tired.
